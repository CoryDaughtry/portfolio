                    I was born January 22, 1986 in Jackson Mississippi. I grew up in a small town south of Jackson for most of my childhood. Growing up I enjoyed
                Skaetboarding, playing football for my high school, and playing drums in a local band. After high school I joined the United States Army and served
                 as an Infantryman for eight years. During my eigher years in the military I was stationed at Fort Hood Texas and spent 15 months total in Iraq where I
                 preformed combat missions in Ramadi, Fallujah, and Bahgdad. After my time in the Army I moved to Dallas Texas where I started college and started bartending.
                 When im not in school or working I enjoy playing music, wakeboarding, cooking out, and going to the gym.
